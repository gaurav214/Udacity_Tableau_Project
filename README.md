## Summary

Data set containing 1,157 baseball players. I will create visualization to analyze performance of players and to categorize star players from good players.

## Design

* I choose pie chart to show the count of handedness as there were only 3 categories and area seems to show good visulization and easy  to differentiate between overall count.
* I looked at how Weight and Height affect overall performance of player by showing a trend line(if i see a trend) and color measure.
* I used scatter plot and created 4 quadrants based on average home runs scored and Batting average to categorize players in 4 levels.
* I created a dashboard which can compare between multiple players and show whether they are star players or have potential.
* I also created a measure height/weight ratio for comparision.

## Feedback

**1) 'Worst' quadrant is not necessarily the worst! These people have high batting averages but they have few home runs - is that necessarily a bad thing? These players can hit lots of singles, doubles, and triple which are definitely good! In line with this, the consistent group includes people that have 0 home runs and 0 batting average! While that is consistent, shouldn't they be considered the worst?**

  Action:     I changed the calculated field and corrected the quadrants for all categories.
  
 **2) I would recommend adding a large title to your histograms of weight and height - they follow similar trends and use the same color scheme - it actually took me a little time to realize that they were different! I know you wrote in the caption and the x-axis weight/height but honestly the font is quite small.**
  
  Action:     I changed the color scheme and font size for both "Performance By weight ratio" and "Performance by height ratio"
  
  **3) Having to scroll evrytime is not good.**
    
    Action:     Changed the story size to Automatic
    
  **4) You should add some formatting to filters also**
    
    Action:    Changed the font size of filters and also added different color schemes to filters for better visual.
  
 **5) Your visualizations are great. In order to evaluate this section we also need to compare your initial design to final design (after feedback revision) therefore for the next submission, please include 2 links in your write-up, one for the initial design and one for the final version and also please document the changes you've made more in detail in the write-up.** 
    
    Action:    Created final story seperately and added both the links.
